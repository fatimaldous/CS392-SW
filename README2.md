# Issues faced (Second Release)
<h2 align="left"> Integrating and running Travis CI in the GitHub project </h2>

- Issue 1 :At the beginning the build kept failing and showing "No Rakefile found" so i downloaded the rakefile and after that it kept failing for other things like "RubyGems" and "RVM".

       Soluiton : Travis used Ruby programming language instead of Node so i changed it Node.js and i deleted the Rakefile previously downloaded.

- Issue 2 : After changing to Node.js it kept showing that the "node is not found".

       Soultion : In the .travis.yml i changed the "node_js : node" to "node_js : 7", after that the build passed.
